# OPWebF

Building a base 1page website utilizing the bootstrap framework.  In the future, CMS will be added so non-coders can manage the site easily.  This is just the base without CMS integration as a proof of functionality.

As a note, since this is all for development and not a launch, files will probably be well commented and none of the css or javascript (outside of framework/libraries not developed by me) will be minified.  These files are more to show principles of web-design that can be used as reference material later.
